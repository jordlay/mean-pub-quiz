<!-- JoinMeeting -->

<p>The video call will remain in place throughout, so you can chat with players at any time. The host may mute you during game play so beware!</p>
<p>You can change your audio and video settings like any other video call</p>


<p>Your name should then appear in the current players box, here you can see who else is in the game</p>
<p>The game cannot start until all players declare themselves as ready. So, when you are ready to play, click the "Ready" button</p>

<p>The reconnect code is important! It is how you will rejoin the game if you get disconnected, write it down!</p>
